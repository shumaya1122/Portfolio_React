        <h2>My Mission</h2>

        <p>
          My mission is to continuously develop my knowledge and skills in
          software engineering and artificial intelligence while creating
          practical and meaningful technology solutions. I aim to apply what I
          learn through academic projects and hands-on development while
          improving my programming, problem-solving, system design, and
          documentation skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also want to continue learning new technologies and gain experience
          that will help me contribute effectively to future software and AI
          projects.
